#TBG README - Aedan McLaughlin 
#Hill 493

In this game you start with your platoon right after capturing an enemy mill. 

Previously being split from half your platoon during an ambush you wait for a radio transmission from your sqaud mates. 

Once you recieve notification that they are assulting an enemy hill you rush to join only to find a slaughter in progress.

When you arrive your platoon is halfway up the hill and cornered, now you must fight to join and save your commrades.

After destroying and overtaking the MG nests caped up top you push forwards towards bunkers to blow up and take control. 

An ambush of reinforcments arrive and start to overwhelm your forces when you are saved by your liuetenant who is shot in the back.

Liuetenant uses his dying breathes to hold off the incoming soldiers as long as he can foir you all to escape.
